This blog mostly serves me rather than the reader. I'll get to making friends by writing on the Internet part later, but first I'll make sure things are clear in my head. It turns out many of them aren't. 

- What happens when you type "google.com" and hit Enter
- Things I've learnt/Mistakes I've made at putting scene.
