Disclaimer: I’m writing this on a bus from goa to Bangalore in a very emancipated state while I have a fever, so most of this will be stream of consciousness writing. But I can’t let bullshit reasons like travelling and having a fever come in the way of publishing. This time I got that DAWG in me. (Also, I’ll owe a friend 1500 if I don’t publish by tonight). 

Let’s start off with big wins in 2025
- Launched first project in collaboration with Judah
  I didn’t actually know what attention to detail and being obsessed about making good software is until I met this guy. He has changed the way I think and work so much in a good way. 
- Got a job as founding engineer at a startup and made their first website, app and product.
  If someone would’ve told me at the start of year that you would launch the first website, app and product of a startup as a founding engineer, I would’ve actually believed you. Because self belief and stuff. But yeah, really proud of myself for having done this. 
- Met Ashima. 
  Why this is a big win is an entire essay in it’s own. There are very few people who fill you with gratitude for having met them. 


All in all, I lived in different [personality basins](https://near.blog/personality-basins/) which rewarded some parts of my personality, thus reinforcing them, but also received some large negative costs forcing me to change some aspects of it. 

One thing I think I was wrong in was that one should do more of “do nothing” or “sitting quietly” to generate interesting thoughts. This stopped me from taking in input even when I was just sitting around. I’ve found that it’s usually the opposite. Most interesting thoughts I’ve had have been while I’m in the thick of action. There’s no need to explicitly “do nothing” until the body demands so. 

Things I wish I do more of in 2026.
- Read significantly more. 
  Getting rid of the “do nothing” mentality will help me fill more of my time with reading. 
- Start giving talks on weekends on topics
  I’m interested in. I’ll stop this if my friends aren’t encouraged to do the same. This can’t be done without reading more.
- Play ambarsariya in front of all friends on 1st of march. I still don’t know how I’ll put in the hours to do this, but I need to. I can’t go longer without learning music. 
- Write and publish more. The reason I’m writing this right now is because I’ve set an accountability bet with Ashima. I’ll owe her fifteen hundred bucks if I don’t do so by tonight. This should keep me on track.
- Program more. Keep grinding away on the brave clojure book and start reading DDIA. 
- Be regular at gym.
  I’m going to unlock muscle up before 1st of March. Will setup accountability bet with someone to make this happen
