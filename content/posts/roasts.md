There are some truths about me that if you'd tell to my face, I would be taken aback. The blow can be dealt as a roast, as a constructive criticism or straight up accusation. But the impact will be the same - destruction of a narrative I've built up inside my head. I usually flinch away from such narrative collapses, but taking them to chin is a skill that can be practiced. This tells me that collecting them in one place so that I can look at them in my darkest moments is a brilliant idea - brilliant enough to say "I'm a genius" but again that's a narrative I'm building which a hater or wellwisher will demolish someday. 

If you hate me or are a wellwisher please write to me at iamabhimanyu08@gmail.com to add to this list.

Feel free to play a *bad-tum-tusss* in your head while reading each on of these. 

- You are trying to be overly intellectual and philosophical without being actually useful and having skills. Get good. 
- You are walking collection of unkept promises. Stop bullshitting and get serious. These unkept promises erode the trust that your loved ones have on you and the second order effects of that are extremely bad.
- You think writing this makes you self-aware. You use this "I'm self aware" badge to get entry to a morally superior club which is full of dipshits who hurt people while being aware of them.
- You think writing the point above makes you more self-aware than those but you are circling around your own bullshit. (Narrator voice: Ok, I'll stop here, this can go very meta)
- No one can tell you've been programming for 9 years.
