Speed shouldn't be something that's exerted. It should be something that happens. Basically, when I see someone moving very fast, be it in using their tools, in their thinking, in their progress towards goals, it's not them trying to move fast, instead they're usually riding the waves of momentum.

For example, when I start playing typeracer, and try to type fast, I usually suck. But sometimes, I start out slowly and deliberately. I go slower than my usual speed optimizing for no mistakes rather than speed. Eventually, as my hand movement and posture align for the purpose of writing fast, momentum builds up and I start kicking ass.

In football matches, if I go for a quick dribble right out of the blocks I lose the ball. But, if I take the time out to let my body adjust itself to the pace and rhythm required for the game, by playing easy passes, scanning the field, doing simple things right, I build enough momentum to start balling out.

In programming, I fall into this pattern too often. Where I try to load too much context into my brain too quickly. Eventually I get overwhelmed and delegate most of the things to an LLM (which then in turn creates context at a faster pace than my brain can handle). But if I take time out to slowly open each file, read through the methods, jump to definitions, let my body become one with the code, I reach a state where the inefficiencies or subtle faults in a particular solution to a problem "feel" wrong and manifest as slight uneasiness. Then, I can pay attention to this uneasiness and look for correct solutions. This is what makes programming so enjoyable. If done right, it can feel like knots untying in your nervous system in real time.
